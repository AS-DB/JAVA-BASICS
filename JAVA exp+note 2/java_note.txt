Thread:-
It's a part of process.
It's a light weight process(It requires less number of resources).

In java, we can create threats in two different ways 

1. By extends Thread class:-
-Thread class is predefined class it contains 'n' number of methods like start(),sleep(),join(),yeild(),run(),etc.

programThreadMain

-By default the name of main thread is main  and name of child thread is Thread-0,Thread-1,...Thread-n 

Thread Priority:-
-->by default main thread priority is 5 and child thread priority is also 5 only
-->getPriority()- its a method,which returns the priority of thread 
-->setPriority(int n)- it assign the specified int value as the priority for the thread,here i value must between 1-10 otherwise we will get error.
-->1 means low priorityand 10 means high priority.

Thread.Min_Priority -->1
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY -->5
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY -->10
